# qbit-rpc

A simple Discord Rich Presence for qBittorrent, tested on Windows & Linux.

## Installation

[pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) are required to run this program.

Installing pnpm (globally) using npm:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

## Usage

1. Make sure you have **enabled the Web UI** in qBittorrent. **qBittorrent MUST be open before starting the Rich Presence.**
2. You not need to modify anything but `config/config.json`, this is to include the `ip`, `port`, `username` and `password` of your qBittorrent WebUI instance.
3. The `filterInactiveUL` / `filterInactiveDL` value is what controls if 'inactive' torrents are shown or not. (`default: false`)
4. `pnpm start` to start the client ( + `pnpm i` to install dependencies if you haven't already)
5. If you are using defaults, the RPC will automatically connect to the qBittorrent WebUI on `127.0.0.1:8080` and will update your status every 10 seconds.

* If the repository is cloned, the program will check for updates on startup.
